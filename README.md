## About

The macOS metadata search API only allows including search folders, not excluding them. But by tagging files as `alfred:ignore`, Alfred can ignore those results. This workflow makes that tagging easier, adding or removing it from entire folder trees.

In addition to Universal Actions, there are Filters to `ignore`, `unignore`, and `reignore`.
